// PROBLEM 1: The Blob. 20 points
//*********************************************************

/* Dowington, PA had 1000 citizens on the night the blob escaped
 its meteorite. At first, the blob could only find and consume
 Pennsylvanians at a rate of 1/hour. However, each time it digested
 someone, it became faster and stronger: adding to its consumption
 rate by 1 person/hour.

 persons consumed  |  rate of consumption
 ------------------|---------------------
        0          |       1/hour
        1          |       2/hour
        2          |       3/hour
        3          |       4/hour

 TODO: First, make a constructor function, called Blob, that makes blobs.
       It should internally (in the constructor) set  this.peoplePerHour to 1 on initialization and have a function
       eatTown that takes a population size and returns the number of
       hours it takes to eat that town! It should also keep track of the
       peoplePerHour increase due to eating the town.

 TODO: Next, create an instance of Blob named blob.
